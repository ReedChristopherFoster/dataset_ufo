g. Add any details from BAIS:3050 - Professional Preparation that Professor Arens 
gave you
- In my BAIS professional prep class I took my Junior year, Professor Arens shared information with us regarding GitHub specifics such as a commit, pull request, and a merge. A commit is a set of changes to the files and folders in your project. A commit exists in a branch. The pull request shows the changes in your branch to other people. This pull request is going to keep the changes you just made on your branch and propose applying them to the main branch. A merge adds the changes in your pull request and branch into the main branch. This is all information proided from her week 5 lecture.
